# First Successful Key Lookup

You are given an interface `Getter`, which retrieves a value for a given key from a remote address. However, you don't know which address has the value, and network calls can fail.

Your task is to implement the Get function that:
* Calls `Getter.Get()` for each address in parallel.
* Returns the first successful response.
* If all requests fail, returns an error.
